\title{nlexperiment: NetLogo experiments}
\description{
Exploration of NetLogo (Wilensky 1999) agent based models.
}
\details{
A tool for NetLogo experiment definition,
  exploring simulation results and model optimization.
  Makes it easy to turn the cycle of experiment definition,
  data analysis, visualisations and
  parameter fitting into readable and reproducible documents.

RNetLogo package (Thiele 2014) is used as an interface to NetLogo environment.

Functions in \bold{nlexperiment} assume the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Define NetLogo experiment object with parameter sets,
   measures and simulation options
   (see \code{\link{nl_experiment}} function).
\item Run experiment (see \code{\link{nl_run}}).
  The result of running an experiment keeps original
  experiment definition
  along with the simulation results and makes the process of model analysis
  more concise and reproducible.
  To run the simulation in parallel working processes
  use the \code{parallel} attribute in \code{nl_run} function.
\item Analyse and present results of simulation(s).
  See \code{\link{nl_get_result}} for getting different data from
  the result and
  \code{\link{nl_show_step}},
  \code{\link{nl_show_patches}} for pre-defined plots.
\item When additional questions pop out, changes to
  experiment will be needed.
  Refine the original definition of the experiment by
  changing only parameter sets (\code{\link{nl_set_param_values}}),
  set different measures (\code{\link{nl_set_measures}}) or set other simulation
  options (\code{\link{nl_set_run_options}}).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Set the path to your NetLogo installation
nl_netlogo_path("c:/Program Files (x86)/NetLogo 5.1.0/")

# Create NetLogo experiment of Net Logo Fire model
experiment <- nl_experiment(
  model_file = "models/Sample Models/Earth Science/Fire.nlogo",
  while_condition = "any? turtles",
  repetitions = 10,
  run_measures = measures(
    percent_burned = "(burned-trees / initial-trees) * 100",
    progress = "max [pxcor] of patches with [pcolor > 0 and pcolor < 55]"
  ),
  param_values = list(
    density = seq(from = 55, to = 62, by = 1)
  )
)

# Run the experiment using multi-core processing
result <- nl_run(experiment, parallel = TRUE)

# Get observations data frame
dat <- nl_get_run_result(result)

# plot percent burned by density
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dat, mapping = aes(x = factor(density), y = percent_burned) ) +
  geom_violin()
}
